### cmath-go? ###

This is a [cgo](http://golang.org/cmd/cgo/) wrapper of [math.h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_mathematical_functions). It warps only a few of the functions and its only purpose is to showcase cgo in action.

### Be warned ###

If you want to use a math library [golang's own math library](http://golang.org/pkg/math/) is your best bet.
